# Reading List

#### By: _**Katie Pundt**_

#### _A web application to create a reading list_

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- npm
- Firebase/Firestore
- git
- GitHub

## Description
Reading list web application created by watching the Net Ninja tutorial found [here](https://www.udemy.com/share/105lrq3@YrF7WbfG3l2xaqtvzy421RsdwgtiZhIJRTrHUgN0tpBZEcL6sglngvWPSeRl9UCk4Q==/). Once a user creates an account, they can add books to their list and delete books from their list. Users can only see books that they've added. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements
- Open the terminal on your desktop
- Once in the terminal, use it to navigate to your desktop folder
- Once inside your desktop folder, use the command `git clone https://github.com/kpundt93/reading-list.git`
- After cloning the project, navigate into it using the command `cd reading-list`
- Use the command `git remote` to confirm the creation of the new local repository
- Install project dependencies by running the command `npm install`
- If you receive errors in the terminal, try running `npm install` again, sometimes npm can be finicky
- Then run the command `npm run start` to start the project server and view the application (use ctrl + c to exit the server in the terminal)
- Open the project with the code editor of your choice

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
